docker-mumble
=============

Docker image for Mumble server.
Forked from https://hub.docker.com/r/phlak/mumble/
Maintained and adjusted by Gymnae

### Running the container

In order to persist configuration data when upgrading your container you should create a named data
volume. This is not required but is _highly_ recommended.

    docker volume create --name mumble-data

After the data-only container has been created run your server container with shared volumes from
the data-only container:

    docker run -d -p 64738:64738 -p 64738:64738/udp -v mumble-data:/etc/mumble --name mumble-server phlak/mumble


##### Optional 'docer run' arguments

`--restart always` - Always restart the container regardless of the exit status. See the Docker
                     [restart policies](https://goo.gl/OI87rA) for additional details.
                     
`-e SERVERPASSWORD="<password>"` - Adds a server password to mumble server on start


##### Get/set the SuperUser password

After starting your container, you can get the randomly generated SuperUser password with:

    docker logs mumble-server 2>&1 | grep "Password for 'SuperUser'"

**--- OR ---**

Manually set a new SuperUser password with:

    docker exec -it mumble-server supw

**NOTE:** This can be run at any time to update the SuperUser password


##### Edit the config

Once you have a running container, you can edit the config with:

    docker exec -it mumble-server vi /srv/mumble/config.ini

After saving changes, restart your container:

    docker restart mumble-server
